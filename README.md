### Abstract

"In this thesis we will look at a multi-path planning problem, where we propose a co-operative multi-agent reinforcement learning perspective. We consider co-operation through shared utilities and communication via learnt meta-protocols. To guide us, we look at a routing problem, widely addressed in PCB design, and resulting in an interesting, but intractable state space problem. 

We first develop our problem scope, by designing and developing our multi-agent environment. We then implement DRQN, leveraging Deep Neural Networks to deal with the large state space and a Recurrent Neural Network to model dependencies between sequential state observations. We show that DRQN outperforms DQN by a large margin in our problem domain, particularly in partially observable settings.

We then distribute our single-agent DRQN solution within a multi-agent setting, considering the unique challenges that arise. We first look at the concept of shared utility and information sharing as a means to co-operate. We then go onto look at explicit, but adaptive communication via Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL), a proposed framework for learning meta-protocols. We find relations in the inner workings of our single-agent DRQN solution and the RIAL framework, as internalising intent and then communicating it.

Our research shows some promises for this approach, however many challenges arise due to the complexity and sparse nature of our problem domain. Thus, with this end-to-end  project we hope to bring forth the promises and challenges within multi-agent reinforcement learning, while directing research attention into this area, which has real world potential, such as in PCB design routing. We finally finish with a discussion of key challenges, drawing profound conclusions and a proposal for future works."
